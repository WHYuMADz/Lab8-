CISC. 3140 Lab 8

Task 1
* The goal for task one is to check wether the input string is a palindrom that returns a boolean value. Allow list input type.The program that I made returns #t if true and #f if it's false.

Task 2
* In task 2, the task was asking to create a lambda expression that evaluates the sum of the fibonacci sequence by the given number n. For the suggested implementation, it is to combine your lambda expression with a map so that you can pass a list of numbers and get the sum of series that returns a list. In my program, it returns the sum of the series.

Task 3
* In task 3, the task is to create a function that will calculate two input paramenters, but only if they're both valid types for calculation. Use Scheme's syntaax and the available functions for checking wether the type of functions that are available are valid. The program that I made returns #t if true and #f if it's false.
